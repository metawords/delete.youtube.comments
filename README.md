In this section, we will tell you how you can do it from your desktop.

* Go to https://www.youtube.com/ from your desktop browser and log in.
* Once you log in, you need to go to your channel. For this, you can select the My Channel option from the upper-left side of your YouTube home page.
* From the list of your videos, select the one you need and scroll down to reach the comment you want to delete.
* When you locate the comment, click on the three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the comment. From the drop-down list, click on Remove. The process is complete, and YouTube will remove your comment.
